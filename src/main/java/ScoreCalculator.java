    // Should take in values from EventParameters, EventResults and Athlete and calculate score and place using
    // given formulae.

   /* The 2001 IAAF points tables use the following formulae:

    Points = INT(A((B — P)powC)) for track events (faster time produces a better score)
    Points = INT(A((P — B)powC)) for field events (greater distance or height produces a better score)
    A, B and C are parameters that vary by discipline, as shown in the table on the right, while P is the performance by the athlete,
    measured in seconds (running), metres (throwing), or centimetres (jumping).

    need to think about and test 1500m dash, where there is hundredth of a second in results...
